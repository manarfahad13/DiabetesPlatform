# DiabetesPlatform
 This project develops a supportive diabetes community platform for sharing meals, thoughts, and questions, tracking blood sugar, and joining events. It offers live chat for patient connection, doctor notifications, insulin calculation, and appointment booking. The website, designed using Balsamiq and Axure, ensures a user-friendly experience.
